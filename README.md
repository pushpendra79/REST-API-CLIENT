## Internship Task 2: Rest API Client

### About the Task  
This project is part of my academic internship, specifically Task 2, which involved building a REST API client in Java. The goal was to fetch and display real-time weather information for a specific city using a public API. This task helped me understand how to consume third-party APIs with Java, manage HTTP requests, parse JSON responses, and present meaningful results to users.

I chose the OpenWeatherMap API, a popular and free weather service that provides current weather data worldwide. The application was developed, run, and tested using IntelliJ IDEA, which offered an efficient environment for writing and debugging Java code.

### Tools and Platforms Used  
- *Programming Language:* Java  
- *API Service:* OpenWeatherMap API  
- *IDE:* IntelliJ IDEA (Community Edition)  
- *JSON Parsing Library:* org.json (included as json.jar)  

### External Resources & Learning Sources  
- *ChatGPT:* Guidance on API integration, error handling, and code refinement  
- *Google:* For documentation, troubleshooting, and code examples  
- *YouTube:* Visual tutorials on Java API consumption, JSON handling, and IntelliJ setup  

### Features Implemented  
- Fetches real-time weather data from OpenWeatherMap for a fixed or user-defined city  
- Displays key weather metrics:  
  - Temperature  
  - Feels-like temperature  
  - Weather description (e.g., Clear, Rain)  
- Handles API errors and no-internet scenarios via exception handling  
- Easily extendable to show additional data like humidity, wind speed, and country  

### How It Works  
The program sends an HTTP GET request to the OpenWeatherMap API with the city name and API key. It receives weather data in JSON format, which is parsed using the org.json library. Relevant data fields are extracted and displayed in a user-friendly format on the console. Users can run the program as-is or optionally input a custom city name.

### Learning Outcomes  
This task provided hands-on experience with:  
- Java network programming  
- REST API fundamentals (requests, responses, HTTP status codes)  
- JSON handling in Java  
- Using third-party libraries (org.json)  
- Debugging and resolving build issues using IntelliJ IDEA  
- Structuring small-scale backend applications  

Additionally, I developed research skills by solving implementation challenges using Google and YouTube, and improved logical thinking and code organization with ChatGPT’s support.

### Real-World Applications  
- Extending into mobile or web weather apps  
- Integration with smart home devices for daily weather updates  
- IoT projects requiring environmental data for automation  
- Backend services for travel apps, event planners, or delivery platforms relying on weather conditions  

### Final Thoughts  
This internship task bridged the gap between theory and practice. It boosted my confidence in handling APIs, writing production-grade Java code, and effectively using tools like IntelliJ IDEA. It also taught me how to leverage online resources like ChatGPT, YouTube, and Google to solve real-world programming problems—an essential skill for any developer today.
